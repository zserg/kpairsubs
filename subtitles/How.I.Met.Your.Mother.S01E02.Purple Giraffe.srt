1
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,542
- OLDER TED: Okay, where was I?
- You were telling us how you met Mom.

2
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,051
- In excruciating detail.
- Right.

3
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:25,921
So, back in 2005, when I was 27,
my two best friends got engaged.

4
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,852
<i>And it got me thinking,</i>
<i>maybe I should get married,</i>

5
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:32,762
<i>And then I saw Robin, She was incredible,</i>

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,302
<i>I just knew I had to meet her,</i>
<i>That's where your Uncle Barney came in,</i>

7
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,804
I suggest we play a little game
I like to call, "Have you met Ted?"

8
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,999
No, no, no, no, we're not playing
"Have you met Ted."

9
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,871
Hi, have you met Ted?

10
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,741
<i>So I asked her out,</i>
<i>and I know this sounds crazy,</i>

11
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,281
<i>but after just one date</i>
<i>I was in love with her,</i>

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,317
<i>which made me say something stupid,</i>

13
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,681
I think I'm in love with you.

14
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:54,754
What?

15
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,948
- Oh, Dad.
- So then what happened?

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,185
<i>Nothing,</i>

17
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,861
<i>I mean, I'd made a complete fool of myself,</i>

18
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,760
<i>So, a week went by</i>
<i>and I decided not to call her,</i>

19
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,389
So, you're not gonna call her?

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,127
You went from
"I think I'm in love with you"

21
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,395
to "I'm not gonna call her"?

22
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,868
I wasn't in love with her, okay?

23
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:15,236
I was briefly in love with
the abstract concept of getting married.

24
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,901
It had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,204
- Robin?
- Hey.

26
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,711
Look who I ran into.

27
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,281
Since when do you guys know each other?

28
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,145
Oh, since about here.

29
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,651
Lily recognized me from the news...

30
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,484
- Hello, sailor.
- They just got engaged.

31
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,517
Well, I should get back to the station.
See you guys.

32
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,264
- Nice seeing you, Ted.
- Yeah, you, too.

33
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,332
Thanks.

34
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,061
- Damn it!
- What?

35
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,433
- I'm in love with her.
- No.

36
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,405
As your sponsor, I will not let you relapse.

37
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,976
- You blew it. It's over. Move on.
- I don't know.

38
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:54,240
I just have this feeling she's the future
Mrs. Ted Mosby.

39
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,314
(SQUEAKING)

40
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,676
Lily, you squeaked?

41
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,981
She said something about me, didn't she?
Come on, spill it, Red.

42
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,076
Fine.

43
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,320
So, what do we think of Ted?

44
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,786
Ted's something else.

45
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,861
Huh?

46
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,460
I'm gonna spin that as good.

47
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,225
Lots of guys are something,
I'm something else.

48
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,823
He comes on a little strong.

49
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,334
But that's part of my charm.

50
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,905
- But that's part of his charm.
- Oh, totally.

51
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,941
I mean, he's sweet, he's charming,
he's just looking for something

52
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,771
a little bit more serious than I am.

53
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,336
I mean, the most I can handle right now
is something casual.

54
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,383
- This just stays between us, right?
- Are you kidding?

55
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,714
This flapper, Fort Knox.

56
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,713
Oops.

57
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,946
She wants casual?

58
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,116
Okay, I'll be casual.

59
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:43,127
I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual.

60
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,527
You know why? 'Cause it's a game.

61
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,396
I wanted to skip to the end
and do the whole happily-ever-after thing,

62
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,992
but you don't get there
unless you play the game.

63
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,732
- So you gonna ask her out?
- Yeah. No!

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,776
I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out
I'm asking her out.

65
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,438
So how do I ask her out
without asking her out?

66
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,050
Did you guys get high?

67
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,749
I got it. I don't ask her out.

68
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,251
I invite her to our party next Friday.

69
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,089
- We're having a party next Friday?
- We are now.

70
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,220
Casual.

71
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,798
Yeah, 'cause nothing says "casual"
like inviting a hundred people

72
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:23,733
over just to mack on one girl.
Oh, and Lily, that's my leg.

73
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,967
You waited five minutes to tell me that?

74
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:32,203
- All right, so call her up.
- No, calling's not casual.

75
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,243
I just got to bump into her somewhere.

76
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,441
Now, if only I knew her schedule,
I could arrange a chance encounter.

77
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,087
That's great, Ted.
You'll be the most casual stalker ever.

78
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,416
<i>Now, ever since Marshall</i>
<i>put that ring on her finger,</i>

79
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,326
<i>Lily had been, well, extra affectionate,</i>

80
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,726
Baby, no.

81
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,126
I have a 25-page paper
on constitutional law due Monday.

82
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,635
I've barely started.

83
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,138
Hey, I'm just sitting here wearing my ring.

84
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,909
My beautiful ring.

85
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,112
Kind of makes wearing other stuff
seem wrong.

86
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,042
My shirt.

87
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,584
Kind of don't wanna wear
my shirt anymore.

88
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,412
Or my underwear.

89
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,456
That's right. I'm not wearing any.

90
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,316
(SIGHING)

91
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,522
- No underwear?
- Not even slightly.

92
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,690
Guys.

93
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,895
Boundaries.

94
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,169
- There she is.
<i>- Thanks, Bill,</i>

...where four-year-old Leroy Ellenberg

has climbed inside a Grab-A-Prize machine
and gotten stuck.

101
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,584
And all in the pursuit
of a stuffed, purple giraffe.

102

For Metro News 1, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

ROBIN: Thanks, Don.

104

Ted?

105
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:07,165
- Robin? Wow, what are the odds?
- What are you doing here?

106
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,868
Oh, you know, just shopping for dip.

107
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,969
I love dip. No, I don't love dip. I like dip.

108
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,173
As a friend, you know.

109
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,842
So, hey, you reporting a news story
or something?

110
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,614
Yeah, a kid stuck in a crane machine.
How sweet of you to call it news.

111
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,452
Wow, kid in a crane machine.

112
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,355
You just had to have that toy, didn't you?

113
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,087
Couldn't play the game like everyone else.

114
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,822
You're all sweaty.

115
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,490
Cute kid.

116
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,962
You know, it's so funny
I should run into you.

117
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,696
We're having a party next Friday
if you feel like swinging by,

118

but, you know, whatever.

119
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,969
Oh, I'm going back home next weekend.

120
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,406
- It's too bad it's not tonight.
- It is. It's tonight.

121
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,945
This Friday. Did I say next Friday?
Yeah, sorry.

122
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,878
I guess I've been saying
"next Friday" all week.

123
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,212
But, yeah, it's tonight. The party's tonight.

- Hello?
- Hey, am I interrupting anything?

127
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,598
No, no, I'm just writing my paper,
hitting the books.

128
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,827
Yeah, well, you and Lily
might want to put some clothes on.

129
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,427
We're throwing a party in two hours.
Okay, bye.

<i>(MUSIC PLA YING)</i>

131
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,843
So, Gatsby, what are you gonna do
when Robin shows up?

132
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,211
Okay, I got it all planned out.

133
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,284
<i>She steps through the door,</i>
<i>And where is Ted?</i>

134
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,719
<i>Not eagerly waiting by the door,</i>

135
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,949
<i>No, I'm across the room</i>
<i>at my drafting table</i>

136
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,789
<i>showing some foxy young thing</i>
<i>all my cool architecture stuff,</i>

137
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,661
<i>So, Robin strolls over,</i>
<i>and I casually give her one of these,</i>

138
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,597
<i>"Hey, what's up?"</i>

139
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,800
<i>She says,</i>
<i>"Hey, nice place, etcetera, etcetera,"</i>

140
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,269
<i>And then I say,</i>

141
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,165
<i>"Well, make yourself at home,"</i>

142
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,210
<i>And I casually return to my conversation,</i>

143
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,609
<i>Then, an hour later,</i>

144
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,808
<i>"Oh, you're still here?"</i>

145
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,375
<i>I say, like I don't really care</i>
<i>but it's a nice surprise,</i>

146
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,512
<i>And then, very casually,</i>

147
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,755
<i>"Wanna see the roof?"</i>

148
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,486
- The roof.
- The roof.

149
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,085
I get her up to the roof
and the roof takes care of the rest.

150
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,562
What's so special about the roof?

151
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,294
Oh, the moon, the stars,
the shimmering skyline.

152
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,465
You can't not fall in love on that roof.

153
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,566
We do it up there sometimes.

154
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,472
- Solid plan, my little friends.
- We're the same height.

155
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,570
But may I suggest one little modification?

<i>and have sex with her,</i>

<i>It should be the plan, I mean, look at her,</i>
<i>Ted, look at her,</i>

00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,657
<i>- She's smoking,</i>
- Thank you.

161
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,986
<i>- Yeah,</i>
- But she's not Robin.

162
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,357
Exactly.

163
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,897
Ted, let's rap.

164
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,065
Statistic.

At every New York party
there's always a girl

166

who has no idea whose party she's at.

167
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,897
She knows no one you know
and you will never see her again.

00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,003
Barney, I don't think so.

170
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:04,549
- Scoping, bip, scoping, bip.
- Man, you're a dork.

171
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,414
Bip, bip, bip, bip. Target acquired!

172
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,852
And now it's time we play a little game
I like to call,

173
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,390
- "Have you met Ted?"
- Oh, come on, not this.

174
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,357
- Hi, have you met Ted?
- No.

175
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,552
- Hi.
- Hi.

176
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,629
- You know Marshall, Lily?
- No.

177
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,359
- Do you know anyone at this party?
- I work with Carlos.

178
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,129
Excuse me. Anyone know a Carlos?

179
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,204
- No.
- No.

180
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,933
On a silver platter. <i>Bon appétit,</i>

181
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,037
I don't think so.

182
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,874
Your loss, her gain.
Excuse me, can I show you the roof?

183
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,642
- It's magical up there.
- Sure.

184
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,580
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, I got that roof reserved.

185
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,120
- Dude, Robin's not coming.
- Hey, she's gonna show up.

186
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,380
She'll show up.

187
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,788
<i>OLDER TED; She didn't show up,</i>

188
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,186
At least, it was a great party.

189
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,698
I ate like four whole cans of dip.

190
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,997
You always know what to say, old friend.

191
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,669
(PHONE RINGING)

192
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,842
- It's Robin.
- Answer it.

193
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,071
No, no, no, not right away.
I gotta seem casual.

194
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,278
- Hello?
- I'm so sorry I missed your party.

195
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,114
- Who is this? Meredith?
- Robin.

196
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,752
Oh, Robin.

197
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,720
Hey, yeah,

198
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,656
- I guess you never showed up, did you?
- No, I got stuck at work.

199
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,228
But they finally got that kid
out of the crane machine.

200
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,527
- Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?
- Yeah, they let him keep all the toys.

201
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,830
He was in there a long time
and little kids have small bladders.

202
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,299
I wish your party was tonight.

203
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,101
It is. The party's tonight.

204
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,207
Yeah, it's a two-day party,
'cause that's just how we roll.

205
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,247
So if you wanna swing by,
you know, it's casual.

206
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,581
See you.

207
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,623
- So that was Robin.
- What are you doing to me, man?

208
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,560
- I got a paper to write.
- I know, I'm sorry. It's terrible.

209
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,598
- I'll buy more dip.
- Ted, Ted, wait!

210
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,926
Get French Onion!

211
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,571
Can you believe this guy?
I got a paper to write.

212
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,674
Okay, fine.
But it's gotta be, like, super quick.

213
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,716
- And no cuddling after.
- I'm the luckiest girl alive.

214
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,152
Oh, you were so right about the roof.

215
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,352
That girl from last night,
I took her back to my place,

216
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,862
then this morning took her outside,
spun her around a couple times

217
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,931
and sent her walking.

218
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,229
She will never find her way back
and there she is.

219
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,564
- How did she get here? Did you invite her?
- I have no idea who that is.

220
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,264
She said she works with Carlos.
Who's Carlos?

221
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,341
I don't know any Carlos.

222
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,408
(GRUNTS)

223
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,445
- Hi, you. You're back.
- I sure am.

224
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,212
- Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.
- Sweetie. Really?

225
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,320
Help.

226
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,517
Whoa, whoa, rabbits.

227
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,785
Come on, I got that roof reserved.

228
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,019
All right.

229
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,461
So, it's over between me
and Works with Carlos Girl.

230
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,533
- Oh, that was fast.
- Yeah.

231
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,793
I was trying to think,
what's the quickest way

232
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,530
to get rid of a girl you just met?

233
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,665
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?

234
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,406
- Thanks, bro.
- Glad I could help.

235
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,046
What the... No, no, no, no, come on.

236
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,680
Sorry, Ted.

237
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,712
Great. What am I gonna do
when Robin shows up?

238
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,745
She'll show up.

239
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,023
<i>OLDER TED; She didn't show up,</i>

240
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:37,192
All right, we threw two parties,
everybody had fun,

241
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,196
everybody Wang-ed, everybody Chung-ed.

242
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,725
Now the kid has got to get to work.
And the kid is not to be disturbed.

243
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,136
Repeat after me,
"I will not have sex with Marshall."

244
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,209
- I will not have sex with Marshall.
- I will not have sex with Marshall.

245
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,868
(PHONE RINGING)

246
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,272
It's Robin.

247
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,680
- Hello?
- Hi, Ted.

248
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:03,221
Amanda? Oh, Denise, sorry.
You totally sounded like Amanda.

249
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,085
- It's Robin.
- Oh, Robin.

250
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,025
- Hi.
<i>- I totally wanted to come,</i>

251
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,028
I got stuck at work again.
I feel like I live there.

252
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,961
Sorry I missed your party, again.

253
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,863
Hey, ain't no thing, but a chicken wing,
<i>mamacita,</i>

254
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,802
Who am I?

255
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,733
I guess there's no chance your two-dayer
turned into a three-dayer?

256
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,240
It did indeed. The party continues tonight.

257
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,539
Yeah, last night people were, like,

258
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,080
"Keep it going, bro! Party trifecta!"

259
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,883
Wow, okay. Well, I'll be there.

260
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,782
Great. See you tonight.

261
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,524
So that was Robin.

262
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,692
<i>OLDER TED; So I threw a third party</i>
<i>for Robin, on a Sunday night,</i>

263
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,326
Oh, this is lame.

264
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,202
Lame or casual?

265
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,067
- Lame.
- Or casual?

266
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:59,305
Hey, law books.
Ready for a little 15-minute recess?

267
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,869
Sorry, baby, I gotta work.
I need all my blood up here.

268
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,978
Has anybody seen

<i>and Restitution Statutes</i>
<i>from 1865 to 1923?</i>

270
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,485
- Anybody seen a big-ass book?
- No.

271
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,861
WOMAN: Hello, Barney.

272
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,994
Of course.

273
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,667
You look well.

274
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,393
Is it weird they invited both of us?

275
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,729
Who?

276
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,402
Who invited you?
No one even knows who you are.

277
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:36,113
I understand you're hurt,
but you don't have to be cruel.

278
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,308
Carlos was right about you.

279
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,312
Who is Carlos?

280
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,218
Hey, where the hell is my...

281
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,646
Oh!

282
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,919
Okay.

00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,732
is not a coaster!

286
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,569
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law career
so you can throw not one,

287
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,202
not two, but three parties
for some girl that you just met

288
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,109
who's probably not even gonna show up!

289
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,876
I mean, where is she, Ted, huh?
Where's Robin?

290
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,677
Hi. Hi, Robin.

291
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,228
So, you threw all these parties for me?

292
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,625
No. Oh, you thought that... No.

293
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,864
Okay, yes. You got me.

294
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:37,499
One of the reasons I threw these parties
was so that I could introduce you

295
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,840
to this guy.

296
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,179
I figured, you know,
since it didn't work out between us

297
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,806
and now we can just laugh about it.

(TITTERING)

299
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,715
- Well, anyway, Robin, this is...
- Carlos.

(BOTH EX CLAIMING)

301
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,991
She's still talking to Carlos.

302
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,133
I can still win this. It's not over.

303
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,668
Okay, buddy, time for the tough talk.

304
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,899
Robin seems great,
but let's look at the facts.

305
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,474
You want to get married

306
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,909
and right now there's a million women
in New York looking for exactly you.

307
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,480
But Robin ain't one of them.

308
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,209
She's not just one of them. She's the one.

309
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,309
Yeah well, "the one"
is heading up to the roof.

310
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,386
What are you gonna do?

311
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,723
Nothing. It's a game. I gotta just

312
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,420
keep playing it.

313
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,836
ROBIN: Hey.
TED: Hey.

314
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,498
- Carlos, can you give us a minute?
- Hey, no sweat, <i>hombre,</i>

315
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,235
See you.

316
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,939
Robin, look, I didn't throw this party
to set you up with Carlos

317
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,076
or the one before that,
or the one before that.

318
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,618
I threw these parties
because I wanted to see you.

319
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,750
Well, here I am.

320
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,021
There's something here.
Look, unless I'm crazy.

321
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,257
You're not crazy.

322
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,593
I don't know, Ted.
I mean, we barely know each other

323
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,703
and you're looking at me with that look
and it's like...

324
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,868
- What, like what?
- It's like, "Let's fall in love,

325
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,277
"and get married and have kids
and drive them to soccer practice."

326
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,148
I'm not gonna force sports on them
unless they're interested.

327
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,751
It's a great look,
but you're looking at the wrong girl.

328
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,756
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

329
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,326
I don't want to get married right now,
maybe ever.

330
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,692
And if we go out together, I'd feel like

331
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,096
I'd either have to marry you
or break your heart

332
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,870
and I just couldn't do
either of those things.

333
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,107
Just like you can't turn off
the way you feel.

334
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,168
Click.

335
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,744
Off. Let's make out.

336
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,745
What?

337
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,215
What? That was the off switch
and I turned it off.

338
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,017
I mean, look, sure, yes, I wanna

339
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,057
fall in love, get married, blah, blah, blah.
But, on the other hand,

340
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,719
you, me,

341
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,455
the roof.

342
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,297
- There's no off switch.
- There is an off switch.

343
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,902
And it's off.

344
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,604
No, it's not.

345
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,871
Yes, it is.

346
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,768
- No, it's not.
- Yes,

347
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,105
it is.

348
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,513
Oh.

349
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,985
No, it's not.

350
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,087
You're right. There's no off switch.

351
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,471
- God, I wish there was an off switch.
- (EXHALING) Me, too.

352
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:25,869
- God, I wish there was an off switch.
- (EXHALING) Me, too.

353
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,543
So...

354
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,773
What do we do now?

355
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,008
We could be friends.

356
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,580
Look, I know it sounds insincere
when people say that

357
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,990
but we could.

358
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,552
I don't know, Robin.

359
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,290
I made such a jackass of myself here,

360
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,491
we start hanging out,
every time I see you, it'll be like,

361
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,660
"Oh, that's right, I'm a jackass."

362
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,004
You're not a jackass.

363
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:04,599
Look, I'm sorry. I only moved here in April,
and I'm always working.

364
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,678
And I just haven't met
a lot of good people so far.

365
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,407
But I understand.

366
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,776
Well,

367
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,819
maybe in a few months
after it's not so fresh we could all,

368
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,859
you know, get a beer.

369
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,952
Yeah. That sounds good.

370
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,425
I'll see you, Ted.

371
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,370
Or, you know, now.

372
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,304
We could all get a beer now.

373
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,183
I'd like that.

374
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:52,253
My friends are gonna love you, like you,
you know as a friend.

375
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,387
Jackass.

376
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,495
Unbelievable.

377
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,030
That's just a recipe for disaster.
They work together.

378
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,103
- You jealous?
- Oh, please.

379
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,469
- What does Carlos have that I don't?
- A date tonight?

380
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,598
(ALL JEERING)

381
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,835
Stop the tape. Rewind, play it again.

382
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,639
(GIBBERING) A date tonight?

383
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,640
I'm not sure I like her.

384
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,874
Hey, don't you have a paper to write?

385
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,316
- Dude, you're talking to the kid.
- I know it.

386
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,981
I'm gonna knock back this beer,
I'm gonna knock back one more beer,

387
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,957
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna write a 25-page paper,

388
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,290
I'm gonna hand it in
and I'm gonna get a "A."

389
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,091
My name is Rufus and that's the Troofus.

390
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,426
<i>OLDER TED; He got a B-minus,</i>

391
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,766
<i>But, still, 25 pages in one night, B-minus?</i>
<i>The kid was good,</i>

392
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,837
At least, let me buy you a beer.
Come on, I'll buy everyone a beer.

393
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,432
I'll help carry.

394
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,716
- You know something, Ted?
- What?

395
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,719
You are a catch.
You're gonna make some girl very happy.

396
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,788
And I am going to help you find her.

397
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,790
Well, good luck.

398
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,883
I mean, maybe,
New York is just too big a town.

399
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,986
I mean, there's millions of people
in this city.

400
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,089
How, in all this mess, is a guy
supposed to find the love of his life?

401
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,532
I mean, where do you even begin?

402
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,499
Hi, have you met Ted?
